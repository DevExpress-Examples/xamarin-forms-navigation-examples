## How to use the Prism framework with the TabPage control 

This example shows how to enable Prism for the DevExpress Xamarin.Forms TabPage and support the following features:
- Use the *selectedTab* argument for tab navigation
- Enable the *AutoWireViewModel* attached property for tabs
- Support the *IActiveAware* interface for a tab's ViewModel

The sample project is created based on the [Prism](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism) framework's (MIT) source code.
